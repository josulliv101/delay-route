# delay-route

This package is experimental. Use with React-Router v4.

[Demo](https://connect-async-work-demo.herokuapp.com/)

### Goals

Delay a route from display until a condition is met.

### Notice

The route 'delay' is visual only. Initially, both the new route (hidden) and the old route appear in the DOM.
